Statistical Analysis of Coffee Ratings: Calculating Z-Scores and P-Values
Project Description
This project performs a statistical analysis of coffee ratings. Using Python, the project calculates Z-scores and P-values to assess the significance of various coffee ratings and draws insights from the dataset.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for analysis.
Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
numpy: For numerical computations.
scipy: For statistical functions and tests.

Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have Python installed and the following libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scipy

Usage
Once the environment is set up, run the Python script to perform the analysis. Example usage:


python "Finding the zscore and pvalue.py"

This script will:

Load the coffee ratings dataset.
Calculate Z-scores and P-values.
Visualize the distribution of coffee ratings.

Features
Statistical analysis of coffee ratings, including calculating Z-scores and P-values.
Visual representation of ratings using plots.
Insights into the significance of rating differences.
